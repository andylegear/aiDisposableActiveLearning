Produced a full implementation prompt with game mechanics, visual design, scoring, and technical constraints."

    "outcome": "Complete working game: 4 source files, 1946 lines, zero dependencies. Five level types with distinct mechanics: timed classification, interactive curve prediction on canvas, nested loop analysis, binary tree visualisation for logarithmic complexity, and animated algorithm races.",
    "observations": "AI produced the entire game engine including 5 distinct canvas visualisation types (bar charts, curve drawing, tree diagrams, race animations) from a single detailed prompt. The prompt design from step 1 was key \u2014 it specified exact level structures, visual design, scoring rules, and file organisation, leaving the AI to focus on implementation rather than design decisions.",
