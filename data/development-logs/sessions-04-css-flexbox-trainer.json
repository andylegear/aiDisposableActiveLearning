        "summary": "Asked AI to conceive an active-learning browser game for teaching CSS Flexbox to 1st year web development students. Constraints: client-side only, zero dependencies, students should type real CSS and see real-time visual updates. AI designed 'Flexbox Forge' \u2014 a 10-level progressive training game with a live code editor, target vs preview split-screen comparison, property reference chips, iframe-based CSS isolation, and a forge/workshop dark theme.",
        "outcome": "AI produced a detailed implementation prompt covering: 10 levels (display:flex \u2192 flex-direction \u2192 justify-content \u2192 align-items \u2192 flex-wrap \u2192 gap \u2192 flex-grow \u2192 align-self \u2192 order \u2192 combined capstone), visual design (dark navy/forge-red/amber theme), real-time preview via iframe srcdoc, property-value checking system, scoring, and 3-file structure (index.html, style.css, game.js)."

Zero external dependencies \u2014 AI attempted to write its own CSS parser and HTML syntax highlighter from scratch.",
        "outcome": "FAILED \u2014 LLM processing timed out. The combined complexity of implementing a bespoke CSS parser, HTML syntax highlighter, 10-level game engine with iframe rendering, and full UI in a single zero-dependency prompt exceeded the model's effective generation capacity. This is the second prompt failure across the study (first was Artifact 3 prompt 2, SQL parser)."

        "summary": "Researcher lifted the zero-dependency constraint for this artifact. Instructed AI to use external client-side CDN libraries instead of writing parsers from scratch \u2014 specifically suggested leveraging existing JS libraries for CSS editing in the browser. Shorter, simpler prompt. AI chose CodeMirror 5 (CSS mode + material-darker theme) for the live CSS editor with syntax highlighting, and highlight.js (xml mode + atom-one-dark theme) for the read-only HTML viewer. This eliminated the need for a custom CSS parser and custom HTML syntax highlighter \u2014 the two components that caused the prompt 2 timeout.",
        "outcome": "Revised implementation approach: 2 CDN libraries (CodeMirror 5, highlight.js) handle editor + syntax highlighting. Game engine (game.js) now only needs: 10-level data, simple regex-based CSS property-value checking (not full parsing), iframe srcdoc rendering, scoring, and overlay system. Significantly reduced prompt complexity."

AI generated all 3 files: index.html (~90 lines \u2014 CDN links for CodeMirror 5 + highlight.js, 2-column CSS Grid layout with code/visual split, iframes, overlay), style.css (~330 lines \u2014 dark forge theme with CSS variables, CodeMirror overrides, highlight.js overrides, chip/hint/match-bar/overlay styling, responsive breakpoints), game.js (~340 lines \u2014 IIFE module, CodeMirror instance, 10 complete levels with data/starter/target/checkProperties/chips/hints/explanations, regex CSS parser, match % calculator, iframe srcdoc rendering, hint system with \u221210pt penalty, scoring 100+50 bonus per level, overlay state machine).",
        "outcome": "SUCCESS \u2014 all 3 files generated in a single prompt. The CDN library approach reduced game.js from an estimated 600+ lines (with custom parser/highlighter) to ~340 lines of pure game logic. Total output: ~760 lines across 3 files."

Replaced the template README with full documentation.",

Emerging pattern: parser-heavy artifacts are the most likely to cause prompt failures. Prompt 3 design revision lifted the zero-dependency constraint. Prompt 4 succeeded \u2014 CodeMirror and highlight.js handled the heavy lifting, letting the AI focus on game logic. This is the first artifact to use external libraries; all previous artifacts were zero-dependency. Research note: the 'disposable' quality may be slightly affected by CDN dependencies (if CDN is down, artifact doesn't work), but the pedagogical core is unaffected.",
