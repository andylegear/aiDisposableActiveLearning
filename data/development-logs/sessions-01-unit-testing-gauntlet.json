      "wakatime_vs_wallclock": "WakaTime captured only ~23% of wall-clock development time (264s of ~1140s). This is because WakaTime tracks active editor interaction (keystrokes, cursor movement, file opens) but cannot observe the chat pane where the primary human-AI dialogue occurs. The AI agent wrote files directly to disk via tool calls, bypassing editor interaction entirely. WakaTime's 'AI Coding' category (14.7s) is near-zero because VS Code inline completions were not used — all code was generated via the agent conversation, which WakaTime cannot attribute.",
      "what_wakatime_measures": "The ~4 mins of WakaTime activity represents the human's review and inspection time: opening generated files, reading through code, and editing the README. It does not reflect authoring effort.",
      "implication": "Traditional developer-activity trackers (WakaTime, RescueTime) drastically undercount effort in chat-driven AI-assisted development. Wall-clock time is the more honest total measure, but WakaTime adds value as a proxy for human review involvement. Both should be recorded and reported for all artifacts."
