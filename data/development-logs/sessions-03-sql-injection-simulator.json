        "summary": "Asked AI to conceive an active-learning browser game for teaching SQL injection concepts. Constraints: client-side only, zero dependencies, ideally involving students writing SQL-like input. AI designed 'SQL Injection Lab' \u2014 a 5-level cybersecurity training game with a lightweight simulated SQL engine, visible in-memory database, real-time query builder with injection highlighting, and a defence level where students parameterise queries.",
        "outcome": "AI produced a detailed implementation prompt covering: 5 levels (Authentication Bypass, UNION extraction, Boolean Blind, Destructive Stacked Queries, Defence Lab), a simulated SQL engine specification (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/DROP, WHERE with AND/OR, UNION, SUBSTRING, comment stripping, stacked queries), visual design (dark terminal aesthetic, split panels for app/query/database/results), scoring, and file structure."

        "type": "design-revision",
        "summary": "Revised approach: eliminated the SQL parser entirely. Replaced with pattern-matching evaluation \u2014 each level has a fixed query template, student input is string-concatenated for visual display, but attack detection uses regex/pattern matching against known injection signatures rather than actual SQL execution. Database panel uses static HTML tables manipulated via DOM. Reduces from 4 files to 3 (no sql-engine.js). Preserves the core pedagogical value (students see their input become part of SQL) while being implementable in a single prompt.",
        "outcome": "Produced a simplified implementation prompt. Key simplifications: (1) no SQL parser \u2014 pattern matching per level, (2) database display is DOM-based not query-driven, (3) reduced from 5 to 5 levels but with simpler mechanics for blind injection (guided stepper instead of freeform), (4) 3 files instead of 4."

AI generated all 3 files: index.html (76 lines \u2014 3-column CSS Grid layout with top bar, app/query/database/results panels, overlay), style.css (413 lines \u2014 dark terminal theme with CSS variables, neon borders, SQL syntax colouring, password cracker animations, defence lab editor, damage report, responsive breakpoints), game.js (~530 lines \u2014 state machine, 5 complete levels with data/templates/detection/objectives/hints/explanations, overlay system for menu/briefings/completion, real-time query builder with injection highlighting, scoring engine, DOM-based database rendering with animations for table drops/row deletes/updates, defence lab with parameterised query validation and attack simulation).",

    "outcome": null,
    "observations": "Prompt 2 failed due to excessive complexity. The SQL parser spec alone was substantial \u2014 asking for SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/DROP with WHERE clause boolean logic, UNION, SUBSTRING, comment stripping, stacked queries, and error tolerance. Combined with 5 game levels each with sub-challenges and visual design, the total output requirement exceeded the model's generation window. Revised to use pattern-matching instead. Prompt 4 succeeded \u2014 the simplified approach generated all 3 files cleanly.",
